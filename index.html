            <h3>Sthala Puranam</h3>
            <p>Maharshi Kalava was in penance for a quite number of years to have the darshan of Lord Narayana. One Durmadhan, son of a Gandarva Viswasu by name was bathing in the tank with his wives. Maharshi Vasishta was returning from Mount Kailash after a darshan of Lord Shiva. Seeing the sage, Durmadhaâ€™s wives stopped bathing and came out of the tank in respect to the sage. But Durmadha continued bathing nude. Angry Vasishta cursed Dhurmada to be born a demon. The wives fell at the feet of Sage Vasishta and begged for relief. Responding to their prayer, sage said that their husband would be back to them in a short time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Durmadha wandering here and there as a demon saw Maharshi Kalava and began to harass him. Rishi prayed to Lord Narayana for protection. Lord granted darshan to Rishi and controlled the demon. With the touch of Lord, Durmadha was relieved of his curse. It is believed that this event took place here.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The other story is that a king Nanda Boopala, ruling this region renounced his kingdom and set out for penance on Lord Narayana. His son Darma Gupta became the king and was ruling the region righteously. When he was in the forest for hunting, dusk set in and the king could not find the way to the camp. He climbed on a tree and began chanting the Gayatri Mantra. A bear, chased by a lion also came to the tree branch and sat along with the king.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The king said to the bear that both would be at a risk if they returned to the ground. The bear suggested that the king may sleep half the night when it would take care of him and that it would sleep the remaining night protected by the king. While the king was sleeping the lion under the tree asked the bear to push the king down. The bear simply said that it could not commit a sin as breach of trust. When the kin woke up and the bear started sleeping the lion made the suggestion to the king. Thoughtlessly, the king obliged the lion pushing the bear down. Shocked by the behaviour of the king, the bear luckily escaping the attack of the lion, cursed the king to become a lunatic. King Nanda Boopala seeing the condition of son Darma Gupta, took him to Sage Jaimini for the cure. Sage suggested that he should have a dip in Palamalai Theertha and worship Lord Ranganatha for recovery. Darma Gupta was thus saved by Palamalai Lord Ranganatha.</p>
